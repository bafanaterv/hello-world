About myself
I am a recent BSc Physics graduate with a strong passion for the intricate workings of the universe. My academic interests include nuclear energy, particle physics, and solid-state physics, all of which fuel my curiosity and drive to explore the fundamental principles of nature.

Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in the dynamic fields of data science, data engineering, and programming. I am fascinated by the architecture of Linux distribution systems and enjoy delving into coding projects to expand my technical expertise.

In my leisure time, I find joy in activities that balance intellectual engagement with physical adventure. My hobbies include reading books, playing chess, skating, and hiking, all of which keep me inspired and energized.

I am a curious learner, always eager to explore new ideas and challenges, particularly in the realms of technology, physics, and creative problem-solving
